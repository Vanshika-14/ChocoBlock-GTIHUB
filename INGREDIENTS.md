1) Baking Chocolate - The chocolate bars used for baking are also known as cooking chocolate. For a really good smooth texture, use a couverture chocolate. Based on your taste preferences, you can opt for a milk chocolate or semi-sweet chocolate or dark chocolate! 

2) Sweetened Condensed milk – You could use any of your favorite brand, but the condensed milk has to be sweetened! 

3) Butter – Both salted and unsalted butter work in the recipe. For unsalted butter, just add a pinch of salt in the chocolate! 

4) Nuts - Adding nuts are totally optional. But I like mine with some chopped walnuts. You could use your favorite nuts or dried berries. You can even skip the nuts altogether!
