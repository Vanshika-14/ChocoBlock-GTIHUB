1) First line an aluminium foil or parchment paper in a 6 x 6 inch square pan. The foil or parchment paper has to cover all the sides. Keep some extra paper or foil hanging on the sides of the pan so that you can easily lift it when the fudge is set and done.

2) Chop chocolate and set aside. You could also just keep the chocolate block in a ziplock bag and break it with a pestle.

3) Take 1 cup chopped couverture milk chocolate, 200 grams sweetened condensed milk (half a can of condensed milk) and 1 tablespoon butter in a bowl or a shallow frying pan.

4) You can use either salted or unsalted butter. You can use semi-sweet or dark chocolate too. Set the bowl or pan aside.

5) Heat about 1 to 1.5 cups water in a sauce pan or pot on a medium to high heat till the water becomes hot and begins to boil.

6) Lower the heat and place the frying pan or bowl containing the chopped chocolate, condensed milk and butter on the saucepan. You can also melt the chocolate in the microwave. I prefer using this double boiler method rather than melting chocolate in the microwave.

7) As soon as you keep the pan, the chocolate will begin to melt with the heat coming from the hot water.

8) Stir often when the chocolate is melting.

9) Stir the fudge mixture non-stop while the chocolate is melting.

10) When all the chocolate is melted, switch off the heat.

11) Quickly add chopped walnuts and vanilla extract or vanilla powder.

12) Mix well.

13) Using a spatula pour the entire fudge mixture in the pan lined with the aluminium foil.

14) Let the fudge first cool at room temperature. Do not cover the pan. When the chocolate fudge has cooled at room temperature, cover the pan and refrigerate it for 2 to 3 hours or overnight, till it sets completely.

15) When set, remove the fudge along with the foil and place it on a chopping board.

16) Slice the chocolate fudge into squares or rectangles. The yield is 350 grams of chocolate fudge from this recipe and makes for about 10 to 12 squares of fudge pieces.

17) Serve these chocolate fudge squares or wrap them in foil or parchment paper and keep covered in a jar or box in the fridge. These stay good for a month in the fridge.
